### Overview
This project aims to predict academic stress levels among students based on various factors such as household stress, coping strategies and competition. This project uses logistic regression to create a model that predicts academic stress.
The goal is to provide insights into the factors that most strongly influence student stress and to demonstrate the application of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation in a real-world context.
